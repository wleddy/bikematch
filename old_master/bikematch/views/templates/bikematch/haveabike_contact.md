## How it works:
Fill out the form here and tell us about the bike.


### Guidelines
1. Participation in the Bike Match program constitues your agreement to the terms of the
[LIABILITY WAIVER](/static/saba_bike_match_liability_waiver.pdf).
1. Donated bikes should be in "ready to ride" condition. Something that you would ride, at least in a
pinch.

2. We will contact you to make arrangements to get the bike from you. Our preferred method is to
meet with you at the Sacramento Bicycle Kitchen in Midtown Sacramento or in another public location
that is convenient to you.
2. For sanitary purposes, clean the bike thoroughly before hand-off 
(handlebars, gear shifters, seat, etc). For the same reason, all bike exchanges are permanent.

We will then try to match the bike with someone in our list of recipients and we will hand the 
bike off to them.

If you have general questions, please [contact us](/contact/).
