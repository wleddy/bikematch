## Alternative Sources for Bikes

Other than local bike shops, here are some alternatives for free or low cost transportation.

### The Sacramento Bicycle Kitchen

The "Bike Kitchen" is a volunteer run organization that provides access to tools and facilities for maintaining
you bicycle. They also sell used bicycles and accept bikes as donations.

For more information see the [Sacramento Bicycle Kitchen web site](http://sacbikekitchen.org).

### Spinlister.com "Wheels for Heros" Program

If you would like to help with SABA Bike Match by donating bike but you're not quite ready to give up your bike for
good, consider a long term "rental" via the [Spinlister.com 'Wheels for Heros' campaign](https://www.spinlister.com/blog/wheelsforheroes/).
They will rent the bike for $1 to a healthcare worker for as long as you are willing.

To be clear, SABA has no association with the Spinlister program. Spinlister.com is a commercial company and
we have no experience with them though they have been recommended by at least one major bicycle manufacturer. If you
are interested please explore the link above and see if it is something for you.
