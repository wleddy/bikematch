## How it works:
Fill out the form here and tell us about the bike.

We will contact you when we have a match for you. You and the recipient will then contact each other
to make your own arrangements to hand off the bike.

### Guidelines
1. Participation in the Bike Match program constitues your agreement to the terms of the
[LIABILITY WAIVER](/static/saba_bike_match_liability_waiver.pdf).
1. Donated bikes should be in "ready to ride" condition. Something that you would ride, at least in a
pinch.

    **As an alternative:** If you have a bike that you're not really using, but you're not quite ready to give up for
    good, consider a long term "rental" via the [Spinlister.com 'Wheels for Heros' campaign](https://www.spinlister.com/blog/wheelsforheroes/).
    They will rent the bike for $1 to a healthcare worker for as long as you are willing.

2. For sanitary purposes, clean the bike thoroughly before hand-off 
(handlebars, gear shifters, seat, etc).
3. The bike hand-off will take place between you and the recipient in an outdoor, 
no-contact exchange in a public place observing social distancing guidelines.
5. For sanitary purposes, all bike exchanges are permanent.

If you have general questions, please [contact us](/contact/).
