## How it works:
Fill out the form here and tell us about the bike.

We will contact you to arrange to get the bike from you.

### Guidelines
1. Donated bikes don't need to be in "ready to ride" condition, but we're not looking 
for project bikes either. 
2. For sanitary purposes, clean the bike thoroughly before hand-off 
(handlebars, gear shifters, seat, etc).
3. The bike hand-off will take place in an outdoor, 
no-contact exchange in a public place observing social distancing guidelines.
2. SABA will perform adjustments and minor repairs that the bikes may need prior to hand-off to recipients.
5. For sanitary purposes, all bike exchanges are permanent.

If you have general questions, please [contact us](/contact/).
