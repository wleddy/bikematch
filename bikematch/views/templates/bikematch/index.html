        We are working closely with the <a href="http://sacbikekitchen.org" target="_blank">Sacramento Bicycle Kitchen</a>
        to provide bikes to those who need them.
    </p>
</div>    
    <p>Bicycles are essential transportation for many who need to get around at any time but especially 
    now during the coronavirus outbreak. This might include traveling to essential jobs, running crucial 
    errands, or participating in mutual aid for vulnerable people who cannot leave their homes.</p>
    <p>Sacramento Area Bicycle Advocates is connecting those who have an extra bicycle to folks in the community
    who need one. Whether you have a bike or need a bike, contact us via the links below, and we will match you.</p>
    

    <h2>How it works:</h2>
    <h3>If you need a bike;</h3>
    <p>Fill out the <a class="w3-button w3-primary-color w3-round-medium" href="{{ url_for('recipient.needabike')}}">I Need a Bike</a> form and tell us about yourself
    and what you need.</p>
    <p>
        We will contact you when we have a match for you and make arrangements to meet and hand the bike off to you.
        Our preferred way to do the hand off is for us to meet at the Sacramento Bicycle Kitchen in Midtown Sacramento.
    </p>
    <p> 
        <strong>IF YOU CAN'T COME TO PICK UP YOUR BIKE</strong>: we will do our best to make other arrangements.
    </p>        
    
    <h3>If you have a bike;</h3>
    <p>Fill out the <a class="w3-button w3-primary-color w3-round-medium" href="{{ url_for('bikematch.haveabike')}}">I Have a Bike</a> form and tell us about the bike.</p>
    <p>
        We will contact you to make arrangements to get the bike from you.
    </p>

        <li>Donated bikes should be in "ready to ride" condition. Something that you would ride, at least in a
