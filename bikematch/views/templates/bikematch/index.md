# SABA #BikeMatch

Bicycles are essential transportation for many who need to get around at any time but especially 
now during the coronavirus outbreak. This might include traveling to essential jobs, running crucial 
errands, or participating in mutual aid for vulnerable people who cannot leave their homes.  

Sacramento Area Bicycle Advocates are connecting those who have an extra bicycle to folks in the community
 who need one. Whether you have a bike or need a bike, fill out the form below, and we will match you.
 
## How it will work:
### If you need a bike;
Fill out the ['needabike' form](/needabike/) and tell us about yourself
and what you need.

We will contact you to let you know what bikes we have and arrange to get it to you.

### If you have a bike;
Fill out the ['haveabike' form](/haveabike/) and tell us about the bike.

We will contact you to arrange to get the bike from you.

### Guidelines
1. Donated bike don't need to be in "ready to ride" condition, but we're lot looking 
project bikes either. 
2. If you are offering a bike, for sanitary purposes, clean the bike thoroughly before hand-off 
(handlebars, gear shifters, seat, etc).
2. SABA will perform adjustments and minor repairs that the bikes may need prior to hand-off to recipients.
3. The bike hand-off will take place in an outdoor, 
no-contact exchange in a public place observing social distancing guidelines.
5. For sanitary purposes, all bike exchanges are permanent.

If you have any questions, please [contact us](/contact/).
