# SABA #BikeMatchSac

Bicycles are essential transportation for many who need to get around at any time but especially 
now during the coronavirus outbreak. This might include traveling to essential jobs, running crucial 
errands, or participating in mutual aid for vulnerable people who cannot leave their homes.  

Sacramento Area Bicycle Advocates is connecting those who have an extra bicycle to folks in the community
who need one. Whether you have a bike or need a bike, contact us via the links below, and we will match you.
 
## How it works:
### If you need a bike;
Fill out the ['Ineedabike' form]({{ url_for('bikematch.needabike') }}) and tell us about yourself
and what you need.

We will contact you to let you know what bikes we have and arrange to get it to you.

### If you have a bike;
Fill out the ['Ihaveabike' form]({{ url_for('bikematch.haveabike') }}) and tell us about the bike.

We will contact you when we have a match for you. The donor and recipient will then contact each other
to make your own arrangements to hand off the bike.

### Guidelines
1. Participation in the Bike Match program constitues your agreement to the terms of the
[LIABILITY WAIVER](/static/saba_bike_match_liability_waiver.pdf).
1. Donated bikes should be in "ready to ride" condition. Something that you would ride, at least in a
pinch.

    **As an alternative:** If you have a bike that you're not really using, but you're not quite ready to give up for
    good, consider a long term "rental" via [spinlister's 'wheels for heros' campaign](https://www.spinlister.com/blog/wheelsforheroes/).
    They will rent the bike for $1 to a healthcare worker for as long as you are willing.

2. If you are offering a bike, for sanitary purposes, clean the bike thoroughly before hand-off 
(handlebars, gear shifters, seat, etc).
3. The bike hand-off will take place between the donor and recipient in an outdoor, 
no-contact exchange in a public place observing social distancing guidelines.
5. For sanitary purposes, all bike exchanges are permanent.

If you have any questions, please [contact us](/contact/).
