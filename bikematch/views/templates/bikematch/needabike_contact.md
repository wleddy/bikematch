 ## How it works:
### If you need a bike;
Fill out the form here and tell us about yourself
and what you need.

We will contact you to let you know what bikes we have and arrange to get it to you.

### Guidelines
2. SABA will perform adjustments and minor repairs that the bikes may need prior to hand-off to recipients.
3. The bike hand-off will take place in an outdoor, 
no-contact exchange in a public place observing social distancing guidelines.
5. For sanitary purposes, all bike exchanges are permanent.

If you have general questions, please [contact us](/contact/).
