 ## How it works:
### If you need a bike;
Fill out the form here and tell us about yourself
and what you need.

We will contact you when we have a match for you. You and the donor will then contact each other
to make your own arrangements to hand off the bike.

### Guidelines
1. Participation in the Bike Match program constitues your agreement to the terms of the
[LIABILITY WAIVER](/static/saba_bike_match_liability_waiver.pdf).
3. The bike hand-off will take place between you and the donor in an outdoor, 
no-contact exchange in a public place observing social distancing guidelines.
5. For sanitary purposes, all bike exchanges are permanent.

If you have general questions, please [contact us](/contact/).
